This command line POC that shows how C# can be used to interact with Microsoft Exchange (EWS). Showing that it can be done in other tooling other than Powershell.
Yes this is a simple POC to show how it could be done. Its not 100%. You want to show off your l33t C# coder or red teamer skills open a pull request plz :)

- Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices

## If someone decides to use this (its already flagged by some A/V's on disk) here are some ideas for IOC:

- Its C#, so AMSI is likely in play on modern systems where it is enabled

- Can write text file to disk

- Uses default .NET user agent string (For example: ... .NET CLR ...)

- When Run the .NET exe could create the temp file in the user's account folder structure with its name.

- GUID of app

- Many more opportunites exist if code is reviewed
